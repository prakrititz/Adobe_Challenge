Learn about approval and certification signatures to determine the type you should choose to sign your document. (See Signature types.) Set signing preferences Signing workflow preferences control what you can see and do when the signing dialog box opens. You can allow certain actions, hide and display data fields, and change how content affects the signing process. Setting signing preferences impacts your ability to see what you are signing. For information on the available signing preferences, see “Signing Workflow Preferences” in the Digital Signature Guide. Customizing signature workflows using seed values Seed values offer additional control to document authors by letting them specify which choices signers can make when signing a document. By applying seed values to signature fields in unsigned PDFs, authors can customize options and automate tasks. They can also specify signature requirements for items such as certificates and timestamp servers. For more information about customizing signatures using seed values, see the Digital Signature Guide. Create the appearance of a certificate-based signature You determine the look of your certificate-based signature by selecting options in the Signatures panel of the Preferences dialog box. For example, you can include an image of your handwritten signature, a company logo, or a photograph. You can also create different signatures for different purposes. For some, you can provide a greater level of detail. A signature can also include information that helps others verify your signature , such as the reason for signing, contact information, and more. 1.

XML data signatures Acrobat and Acrobat Reader support XML data signatures that are used to sign data in XML Forms Architectures (XFA) forms. The form author provides XML signing, validating, or clearing instructions for form events, such as button click, file save, or submit. XML data signatures conform to the W3C XML-Signature standard. Like PDF digital signatures, XML digital signatures ensure integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation in documents. However, PDF signatures have multiple data verification states. Some states are called when a user alters the PDF-signed content. In contrast, XML signatures only have two data verification states, valid and invalid. The invalid state is called when a user alters the XML-signed content. Establish long-term signature validation Long-term signature validation allows you to verify the signature's validity long after the document was signed. To achieve this, all the necessary elements for signature validation must be embedded in the signed PDF. These elements can be embedded during the document signing process or added afterward. If certain information is not included in the PDF, the signature can only be validated for a limited time because certificates related to the signature eventually expire or are revoked. When a certificate expires, the issuing authority is no longer responsible for providing revocation status, rendering the signature unverifiable. The necessary elements for signature validity include the signing certificate chain, certificate revocation status, and possibly a timestamp. If these elements are embedded during signing, the signature can be validated without requiring external resources. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader can embed the necessary elements if available, and the PDF creator must enable usage rights for Acrobat Reader users by going to the hamburger menu (Windows) or the Acrobat menu (macOS) > Save as other > Acrobat Read

Adobe LiveCycle Rights Management (ALCRM) servers Adobe LiveCycleRights Management (ALCRM) servers let you define centralized policies to control access to documents. The policies are stored on the ALCRM server. You require server access to use them. ALCRM servers embed user access information in documents. Therefore, specify document recipients in ALCRM policies. Alternatively, let the ALCRM server retrieve the list of recipients from LDAP directories. Use ALCRM servers to set permissions for separate document tasks, for example opening, editing, and printing. You can also define document auditing policies on ALCRM servers. What is a digital signature? Digital signatures are a secure and efficient way to electronically sign and authenticate documents, ensuring their authenticity and integrity. By using digital signatures, you can sign documents quickly and easily, and be confident that they can’t be tampered with or forged. Why validate a digital signature? When you receive a signed document, you may want to validate its signature to verify the signer and the signed content. Depending on how you’ve configured your application, validation may occur automatically. Signature validity is determined by checking the authenticity of the signature’s digital ID certificate status and document integrity. To verify authenticity, the validator checks if the signer's certificate or its parent certificates are trusted. The validity of the signing certificate is also checked based on the user's Acrobat or Acrobat Reader settings. To verify document integrity, the validator checks if the signed content was altered after signing. If changes were made, the verification ensures that the signer allowed the changes.

Signer's experience A signer receives an email with a link to sign the agreement. Also, if the signer uses Acrobat or Acrobat Reader desktop application, the signer sees a notification that an agreement has been shared for signing. Note: Signers are not required to sign up or purchase any Adobe product to sign agreements. They can sign agreements using a web browser, mobile device, or Acrobat / Acrobat Reader desktop application. Send in bulk allows you to upload a form and use that as a template to create and send many (hundreds!) of unique agreements, each dedicated to one external signer. Each agreement is insulated from the others and contains its own audit report. Each recipient is unaware of all other recipients. The sender has access to the agreements through their Home or Documents tab or through the Send in bulk template, which contains an Agreements report that tracks the overall status of the child agreements created from the template. Additionally, the sender can export the field-level data of all completed agreements in a CSV format using the Download Form Field Data action.

Once the roaming ID is added, it can be used for signing or encryption. When you perform a task that uses your roaming ID, you’re automatically logged in to the roaming ID server if your authentication assertion hasn’t expired. PKCS#12 modules and tokens You can have multiple digital IDs that you use for different purposes, particularly if you sign documents in different roles or using different certification methods. Digital IDs are usually password protected. They can be stored on your computer in PKCS #12 file format. Digital IDs can also be stored on a smart card, hardware token, or in the Windows certificate store. Roaming IDs can be stored on a server. Acrobat includes a default signature handler that can access digital IDs from various locations. Register the digital ID in Acrobat for it to be available for use. Store certificates on directory servers Directory servers are commonly used as centralized repositories of identities within an organization. The server acts as an ideal location to store user certificates in enterprises that use certificate encryption. Directory servers let you locate certificates from network servers, including Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) servers. After you locate a certificate, you can add it to your list of trusted identities so that you don’t have to look it up again. By developing a storage area for trusted certificates, you or a member of your workgroup can facilitate the use of encryption in the workgroup. For more information about directory servers, see the Digital Signature Guide. Import directory server settings (Windows only) You import dir

Note: You can right-click a signature field in the Signatures panel to do most signature- related tasks, including adding, clearing, and validating signatures. In some cases, however, the signature field becomes locked after you sign it. Sign in preview mode for document integrity When document integrity is critical for your signature workflow, you can enable 'View documents in Preview mode', and then sign the document. This feature analyzes the document for content that may alter the look and feel of the document and suppresses such content to allow you to view and sign the document in a static and secure state. By signing in preview mode, you can find if the document contains: • Any dynamic content or external dependencies. • Any constructs such as form fields, multimedia, or JavaScript™ that may affect its look and feel. After reviewing the report, you can contact the author of the document about the problems listed in the report. Certify a PDF Certifying a PDF means approving its contents and specifying what changes are allowed for the document to remain certified. For example, a government agency creates a form with signature fields and certifies it, allowing users to only change form fields and sign the document. Removing pages or adding comments will result in losing the certified status. A certifying signature can only be applied if the PDF has no other signatures. These signatures can be visible or invisible, and a blue ribbon icon in the Signatures panel confirms a valid certifying signature. Adding a certifying digital signature requires a digital ID. Timestamp a document Acrobat allows users to add a document timestamp to a PDF without needing an identity- based signature. To timestamp a PDF, a timestamp server is needed.

Why use certificate signatures? Many business transactions, including financial, legal, and other regulated transactions, require high assurance when signing documents. When documents are distributed electronically, it's important that recipients can: • Verify document authenticity—confirming the identity of each person who signed the document • Verify document integrity—confirming that the document has not been altered in transit Certificate-based signatures provide both of these security services. Many businesses and governments have chosen to set up a certificate-based digital signature infrastructure within their organization. They use third-party certificate authorities to provide independent identity validation. Examples include: For instance, companies in the European Union who need to comply with advanced or qualified electronic signature requirements in eIDAS e-signature regulation or the ETSI PAdES standard (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures). What can I do with certificate IDs? Once certificate-based digital IDs have been provided to end users, they can use Acrobat or Acrobat Reader software to sign PDF files and validate files they receive from others. Sign documents • Sign PDF files using certificate IDs • Place a signature box anywhere on the page • Add multiple signatures to a page • Add a time stamp to the document when working with a configured timestamp server • Certify a document with a visible or hidden signature so that recipients can verify authenticity with or without seeing a visible signature on the page • Automatically embed certificate data to support long-term validation Validate documents • Validate all signatures, confirming the identity of everyone who signed the document • Validate document integrity by tracking all previously signed versions of a document to verify changes made during the document’s lifecycle

Export You can save your changes to an Adobe PDF or PDF Portfolio in the original PDF or in a copy of the PDF. You can also save individual PDFs to other file formats, including text, XML, HTML, and Microsoft Word. Saving a PDF in text format allows you to use the content with a screen reader, screen magnifier, or other assistive technology. If you don’t have access to the source files that created an Adobe PDF, you can still copy images and text from the PDF to use elsewhere. You can also export the PDF to a reusable format, or export images in a PDF to another format. Adobe Acrobat Reader users can save a copy of a PDF or PDF Portfolio if the creator of the document has enabled usage rights.

A text box remains visible on the document page; it doesn’t close like a pop-up note. Text font and size are based on the system's default settings. Note: You can add comments to Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text with the Text Box tool, but you must have the Asian-language resource files installed. Text boxes allow for horizontal text only. You can use the Text callout tool to create a callout text box. Callout text boxes are handy when you want to single out—but not obscure—a particular area of a document. Callout text boxes have three parts: a text box, a knee line, and an end-point line. You can resize each part by dragging a handle. The knee line can be resized in one direction only; horizontal knee lines can be resized horizontally only; vertical knee lines can be resized vertically only. The text box expands vertically as you type so that all text remains visible. You can move the text box itself or together with the end-point line.

Edit images or objects in a PDF About editing text and images Adobe Acrobat provides powerful tools and capabilities for editing PDF images and text. You might encounter formatting challenges that require manual adjustments. Acrobat's image-editing capabilities are limited, and using high-resolution images can lead to performance issues due to larger file sizes. To address this, improve images using other tools before adding them to PDF documents. If the original font isn't available, font substitutions may occur, altering the text's appearance. To maintain consistency across devices, we suggest you use the available fonts or embed them within the PDF. You can also enhance document accessibility using Acrobat's features, such as adding alternative text for images and proper content tagging. Refer to the following topics to learn how to add, resize, move, or replace images and objects in a PDF using Acrobat. Add images in a PDF 1. Open the PDF in Acrobat. Select Edit a PDF from the All tools menu and then select Image. 2. From the drop-down menu, select Choose image to select an image from your device or Select Generate image to generate an image from text.

What’s the best way to create a PDF? You can create PDFs from documents printed on paper, Microsoft Word documents, InDesign® files, digital images, and more. Diﬀerent types of sources have diﬀerent tools available for PDF conversion. In many applications, you can create PDFs by selecting the Adobe PDF printer in the Print dialog box. If a file is open in its authoring application (such as a spreadsheet that is open in Microsoft Excel), you can convert it to PDF without opening Adobe Acrobat. Similarly, if Acrobat is already open, you don’t have to open the authoring application to convert a file to PDF. Every PDF balances eﬃciency (small file size) and quality (such as resolution and color). If the balance between the file size and the quality is critical to your task, you must use an appropriate conversion method. For example, you can drag files to the Acrobat icon to create PDFs. In this case, Acrobat applies the most recently used conversion settings without providing access to those settings. If you want more control over the process, you’ll want to use another method. PDF creation methods by file type Refer to the following lists to determine the methods available for the diﬀerent types of files. File Type PDF Creation Methods Any file format Method 1: From the top tools bar, select Create. Then, select a file type and then select the file that you want to convert to PDF. Or, select the hamburger menu (Windows) or the File menu (macOS) > Create and then select the appropriate file type and follow through the steps.

When you open a scanned document, Acrobat automatically runs OCR in the background to make the document editable. Before editing, review the document to ensure that the content is accurate and complete. If necessary, rescan the document using the Scan & OCR > Recognize Text tool to improve the output. Enhance image quality. If the scanned PDF contains low-quality images, use the Enhance scanned file or Enhance camera image feature to improve the quality of images before attempting to edit the document. For more information, see Scan documents to PDF. Use the correct font and formatting. When editing the document, ensure that the font and formatting of the edited text match the original document as closely as possible. If you don't have the desired fonts on your computer, see Add fonts to your computer. Remove security restrictions. If the scanned PDF has security restrictions that prevent editing, remove these restrictions before attempting to edit the document. To know how to remove security from a PDF, see Unlock a PDF. Avoid editing complex elements. If the scanned PDF contains tables, graphs, or images, avoid unnecessary edits that could alter the layout or formatting of these elements. Check for compatibility issues. Ensure that the version of Adobe Acrobat you're using is compatible with the scanned PDF. If you encounter compatibility issues, try updating Adobe Acrobat.

Note: The generative AI features are only available in English for users with Individual or Teams entitlements. Users with Enterprise entitlements may only receive Acrobat generative AI features when their admin assigns them with a paid or trial license, or if they are accepted into one of the programs in our private beta. You can disable the generative AI feature by following the steps outlined here. Once disabled, no documents will be processed through generative AI in Acrobat until you activate the feature set again. What LLMS are we leveraging to power generative ai in acrobat? With AI Assistant in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader, Adobe takes an LLM-agnostic approach, selecting best-in-class technologies that address a range of customer use cases. We currently have integrated the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service with our proprietary technologies to provide generative AI capability in Acrobat and Acrobat Reader. Does adobe concurrently train any large language models (“LLMS”) with your content while you're using generative ai features in acrobat? No. Acrobat does not train any LLMs on your content concurrent to your interactions with generative AI in Acrobat. Prompts provided to AI Assistant do not modify the underlying model. Your content will not be used to train any LLMs that deliver Acrobat’s generative AI capability. For more information, please refer to the questions above in this help section (Content Usage and Handling Practices). Note: Adobe does not use content from an organization or school account for product improvement for generative AI unless otherwise agreed to by the organization or school.

If you have questions about the document, scroll to the bottom, and select Ask AI Assistant. Streaming summaries for long PDFs When you use Generative summary to scan lengthy PDFs, Acrobat or Acrobat Reader processes the content in chunks and simultaneously streams summaries of the portions that it processes. It helps improve your productivity because you can instantly review the output and stay engaged. The key advantages of streaming summaries include: • Real-time streaming: As Acrobat or Acrobat Reader processes a lengthy PDF, it concurrently streams summaries for sections it has already analyzed. It helps eliminate any latency associated with summarizing voluminous content. • Segmented display: When you start generating the summary for your content, you'll immediately see summarized content for the sections that the Generative summary feature finished processing. • Parallel processing: While you engage with the summarized sections, the feature extracts headings, and generates summaries for the subsequent sections. Use generative AI features in meeting apps You can harness the power of generative AI features in Acrobat to gain insights from transcripts of online meetings in Microsoft Teams and Zoom. Use the generative AI features to summarize discussions or draft emails for meeting notes or action items. You can access the generative AI features from Acrobat Reader, Acrobat desktop and online, and Acrobat for Microsoft Teams.

Convert a file to PDF using PDFMaker In Windows, Acrobat installs both an Acrobat PDFMaker toolbar and an Adobe PDF menu in many popular authoring applications. You can use either the toolbar buttons or the Adobe PDF menu (the Action menu in Lotus Notes) to create PDFs, but the menu also provides access to conversion settings. Although many of the conversion options are common to all authoring applications, a few are application-specific. For Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, the options for creating PDFs are available from the Acrobat ribbon. Note: If you don’t see the PDF toolbar buttons in an application, you must show or activate the PDF toolbar. For other troubleshooting issues, see Troubleshoot Acrobat PDFMaker Problems. Show or activate PDFMaker in Microsoft Office and Lotus Notes If the PDF toolbar buttons don’t appear in your Microsoft Office or Lotus Notes application, use one of the following methods to show or activate PDFMaker. For Lotus Notes 9, choose File > Preferences. In the dialog box that appears, choose Toolbar > Toolbars, and select the Visible option for Acrobat PDFMaker.

Note: See also Export security settings. Add a timestamp to certificate-based signatures You can include the date and time you signed the document as part of your certificate-based signature. Timestamps are easier to verify when they are associated with a trusted timestamp authority certificate. A timestamp helps to establish when you signed the document and reduces the chances of an invalid signature. You can obtain a timestamp from a third-party timestamp authority or the certificate authority that issued your digital ID. Timestamps appear in the signature field and in the Signature Properties dialog box. If a timestamp server is configured, the timestamp appears in the Date/Time tab of the Signature Properties dialog box. If no timestamp server is configured, the signatures field displays the local time of the computer at the moment of signing. Note: If you did not embed a timestamp when you signed the document, you can add one later to your signature. (See Establish long-term signature validation.) A timestamp applied after signing a document uses the time provided by the timestamp server. Configure a timestamp server To configure a timestamp server, you need the server name and the URL, which you can obtain from an administrator or a security settings file. If you have a security settings file, install it and don’t use the following instructions for configuring a server. Ensure that you obtained the security settings file from a trusted source.

Renumber pages in a PDF The page numbers on the document pages don't always match the page numbers that appear below the page thumbnails and in the right Page Navigation toolbar. Pages are numbered with integers, starting with page 1 for the first page of the document. Because some PDFs may contain front matter, such as a copyright page and table of contents, their body pages may not follow the numbering shown in the right Page Navigation toolbar. You can specify various numbering styles for a group of pages, for example, 1, 2, 3, or i, ii, iii, or a, b, c. You can also customize the numbering system by adding a prefix. For example, pages in Chapter 1 can be 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, and so on. Chapter 2 can have pages numbered as 2-1, 2-2, 2-3, and so on. Note: Using the Number Pages command affects only the page thumbnails on the Pages panel. You can physically add new page numbers to a PDF using the headers and footers feature. 1.

You can use this technique with many other types of files, but you cannot adjust any conversion settings during the process. 1. Select the icons of one or more files in the Windows Explorer or macOS Finder. 2. Drag the file icons onto the Acrobat application icon. Or (Windows only) drag the files into the open Acrobat window. If a message appears saying that the file could not be opened in Acrobat, then that file type cannot be converted to PDF by the drag-and-drop method.

Recover the last saved version 1. On Windows, choose the hamburger Menu > Undo, Redo & more > Revert. On macOS, select the File menu > Revert. About the Autosave feature The Autosave feature guards against losing your work in case of a power failure by incrementally, and at regular intervals, saving file changes to a specified location. The original file is not modified. Instead, Acrobat creates an autosave file of changes, which includes all the changes you made to the open file since the last automatic save. The amount of new information that the autosave file contains depends on how frequently Acrobat saves the autosave file. If you set the autosave interval to 15 minutes, you could lose the last 14 minutes of your work if a problem occurs. Frequent automatic saving prevents loss of data, and is especially useful if you make extensive changes to a document, such as by adding comments. You can apply autosave changes to the original files when you restart Acrobat. When you close, save manually, or revert to the last-saved version of a file, the autosave file is deleted. Note: If you use assistive technology, such as a screen reader, you may want to disable the Autosave feature so that you don’t lose your place when the file is reloaded. The Autosave feature won’t work in the following cases: • A document that has its security changed. You must save the document to re-enable automatic saving of document changes. • A document created using the Web Capture feature or extracted from a larger PDF (All tools > Organize Pages > Extract). You must save the document to enable automatic saving of changes. • A document displayed in a web browser or incorporated into a container document that supports Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). This document appears outside the default file system and cannot support automatic saving.
